Fork description:
===============================

1. Package name changed: org.json -> org.json.android (no need to shade)
2. Duplicate keys allowed (no more "Duplicate key" exception)
3. Preserve order of element (+test)
4. JDK 1.6 -> 1.8

All changes marked with [Fork] comment.

Using this version in Android app will allow you to get an iterator for JSONArray, "similar" and other features not available in the standard org.json package from the Android SDK.

To keep it similar to the standard Android package, the fork allows duplicate keys during parsing and preserves the order of adding elements by using LinkedHashMap, so it can be used in the JVM as well if you need this features.

*How to use:*

[Add Jitpack repo to project](https://jitpack.io/#vellrya/JSON-android/4b198d92fb), then import:

    dependencies {
        implementation 'com.github.vellrya:JSON-android:4b198d92fb'
    }

Replace all "import org.json." -> "import org.json.android." with the IDE.
For future import you should use classes from org.json.android package.
Done.

Based on ver. 20230227

# Overview

[JSON](http://www.JSON.org/) is a light-weight language-independent data interchange format.

The JSON-Java package is a reference implementation that demonstrates how to parse JSON documents into Java objects and how to generate new JSON documents from the Java classes.

Project goals include:
* Reliable and consistent results
* Adherence to the JSON specification 
* Easy to build, use, and include in other projects
* No external dependencies
* Fast execution and low memory footprint
* Maintain backward compatibility
* Designed and tested to use on Java versions 1.6 - 1.11

The files in this package implement JSON encoders and decoders. The package can also convert between JSON and XML, HTTP headers, Cookies, and CDL.

For more information on contributions, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Bug fixes, code improvements, and unit test coverage changes are welcome! Because this project is currently in the maintenance phase, the kinds of changes that can be accepted are limited. For more information, please read the [FAQ](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java/wiki/FAQ).

# Build Instructions

The org.json package can be built from the command line, Maven, and Gradle. The unit tests can be executed from Maven, Gradle, or individually in an IDE e.g. Eclipse.
 
**Building from the command line**

*Build the class files from the package root directory src/main/java*
````
javac org/json/*.java
````

*Create the jar file in the current directory*
````
jar cf json-java.jar org/json/*.class
````

*Compile a program that uses the jar (see example code below)*
````
javac -cp .;json-java.jar Test.java (Windows)
javac -cp .:json-java.jar Test.java (Unix Systems)
````

*Test file contents*

````
import org.json.android.JSONObject;
public class Test {
    public static void main(String args[]){
       JSONObject jo = new JSONObject("{ \"abc\" : \"def\" }");
       System.out.println(jo.toString());
    }
}
````

*Execute the Test file*
```` 
java -cp .;json-java.jar Test (Windows)
java -cp .:json-java.jar Test (Unix Systems)
````

*Expected output*

````
{"abc":"def"}
````

 
**Tools to build the package and execute the unit tests**

Execute the test suite with Maven:
```
mvn clean test
```

Execute the test suite with Gradlew:

```
gradlew clean build test
```
